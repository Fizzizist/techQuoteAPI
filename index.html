        <h1>Tech Quote API by Peter Vlasveld</h1>
        <p>As I was completing the <a href="#">random quote machine</a> project at freeCodeCamp, I decided that I wanted to use tech quotes that I could relate to so that I could also add my quote machine to my <a href="#">portfolio page</a>.<br>
        I searched for a simple and free tech quote API online but I couldn't find one, so I decided that I would just build my own. I did some research on Node.js and set up this API using my previous experience with MySQL.</p>
        <p>I am sharing this API free for anyone to use in case you are also looking for a JSON API that randomly generates tech quotes. So enjoy:</p>
